# Regex-Emails
My org receives 100s of automated emails from our local *call-before-you-dig* organization every time they generate a ticket to locate our utilities.  The information is then entered into a spreadsheet.  Very labor intensive.

This unfinished project was an attempt to use regex to parse in information needed from the emails then write it to a csv.

The project was put on hold for administrative purposes.  I had planned to  change to C# when I took up the project again.  However, my supervisor wanted to tackle it.  He used C# to read an xml file that we are emailed, then the information is written to a database.  A much more elegant solution. 

I liked working with regex my first, and only, time.  It made sense to me.
